[Intro]
A
(Spoken) Timewarp..T.T.T.T.Timewarp.....are you ready?
A
(Spoken) So you think you can do the timewarp eh? Well let me tell you hahaha....

[Verse]
A                        B         G       D         A
It's astounding, time is fleeting, madness takes its toll.
A                                      B       G        D       A
But listen closely - not for very much longer, I've got to keep control
 
[Chorus]
A                       E                            A
It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right
A                       E                             A
With your hands on your hips, you bring your knees in tight
A                   D                                 A
But it's the pelvic thrust, that really drives you in-sane
F     C      G    D    A      F     C      G    D    A
Let's do the Time Warp again! Let's do the Time Warp again!

[Verse]
A                           B                     G      D         A
It's so dreamy - oh fantasy free me! So you can't see me no not at all.
A                                            B    
In another dimension, with voyeuristic inten-tion,  
     G        D         A
Well secluded I'll see all

[Chorus]
A                       E                            A
It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right
A                       E                             A
With your hands on your hips, you bring your knees in tight
A                   D                                 A
But it's the pelvic thrust, that really drives you in-sane
F     C      G    D    A      F     C      G    D    A
Let's do the Time Warp again! Let's do the Time Warp again!

        A
(Spoken)Put your right hand up above your head and your left hand too like my sister said
        A
(Spoken)Bring both hands slowly to you hips now move your body and lick your lips, lick your lips
        A
(Spoken)Now jump to the left, and step to the right, you've got the timewarp, now get it right
        A
(Spoken)L.L.L.Let's exercise...L.L.L.Let's exercise...L.L.L.Let's exercise...L.L.L.Let's exercise...

[Chorus]
A                       E                            A
It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right
A                       E                             A
With your hands on your hips, you bring your knees in tight
A                   D                                 A
But it's the pelvic thrust, that really drives you in-sane
F     C      G    D    A      F     C      G    D    A
Let's do the Time Warp again! Let's do the Time Warp again!
F     C      G    D    A      F     C      G    D    A
Let's do the Time Warp again! Let's do the Time Warp again!  (Fade)
