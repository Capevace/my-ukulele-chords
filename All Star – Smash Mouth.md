```
    G         D           Am             C
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me 
  G                  D           Am   C
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed 
        G             D             Am
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her 
C            G            D         Am       C
Thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead 

         G                           D
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming 
Am                     C
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running 
G                        D
Didn't make sense not to live for fun 
     Am                        C
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb 
G             D
So much to do so much to see 
          Am                    C
So what's wrong with taking the back streets 
       G                       D
You'll never know if you don't go 
       Am                       C
You'll never shine if you don't glow 


[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold
