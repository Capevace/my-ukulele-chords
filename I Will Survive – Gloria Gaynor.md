[Intro]
Am                        Dm
First I was afraid, I was petrified
              G7                             C
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
      Am                            Dm
But I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
       E                 E7
I grew strong, I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
              Am              Dm
And so you're back from outer space
              G7                  
I just walked in to find you here 
              C
with that sad look upon your face
              Am                     
I should have changed my stupid lock 
              Dm
I should have made you leave your key
         E                         
If I had known for just one second 
         E7
you'd be back to bother me

[Chorus]
          Am              Dm
Go on now go walk out the door
          G7                           C
just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
        Am                       Dm
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
                  E                          E7
did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die
           Am           Dm
Oh no, not I, I will survive
   G7                           C
as long as i know how to love I know I will stay alive
         Am                            Dm
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
         E               E7
and I'll survive, I will survive

[Instrumental] x2
 Am    Dm    G7    C    
 Am    Dm    E     E7 

[Verse 2]
        Am                            Dm
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
            G7                            C
kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
            Am                             Dm
and I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
           E           E7
I used to cry,   Now I hold my head up high
            Am          Dm
and you see me somebody new
             G7                                C
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
            Am                              Dm
and so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
           E                         E7
now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

[Chorus]
