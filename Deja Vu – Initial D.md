[Verse]
Cm
See your body into the moonlight
Ab        Bb
Even if I try to cancel
Cm
All the pictures into the mind
          Gm             Ab
There's a flashing in my eyes
 
[Bridge]
                Ab          Bb
Don't you see my commission, the nation
Gm       Ab
Has gone running again
                  Ab
Can't you see now, illusions
Bb              C
Right into your mind
 
[Chorus]
     Ab
Deja vu
          Bb           Cm
I've just been in this place before
              Ab
Higher on the street
      Bb           F
And I know it's my time to go
        Ab           Bb          Cm
Calling you, and the search is a mystery
               Ab
Standing on my feet
        Bb          F             Gm
It's so hard when I try to be me, woah
     Ab
Deja vu
          Bb           Cm
I've just been in this time before
              Ab
Higher on the beat
      Bb          F
And I know it's a place to go
        Ab          Bb          Cm
Calling you and the search is a mystery
               Ab
Standing on my feet
        Bb          F             Gm
It's so hard when I try to be me, yeah

See the future into the present
Ab                 Bb
See my past leaves in the distance
Cm
Try to guess now what's going on
        Gm             Ab
And the band begins to play
 
[Bridge]
                Ab          Bb
Don't you see my commission, the nation
