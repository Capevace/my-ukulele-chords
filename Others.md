[Verse 1]
     Em
Well Folks, here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher,
C7                   B7      Em
  She was a low-down hoochie-cootcher,
Em
  She was the roughest, toughest frail,

[Verse 2]
Em
  She messed around with a bloke named Smoky,
C7                     B7     Em
  She loved him though he was cokie, 
Em
  He took her down to Chinatown, 
       C7                         B7    Em

Em
  She had a dream about the king of Sweden,
C7                        B7      Em
  He gave her things that she was needin',
Em
  He gave her a home built of gold and steel, 
((DOUBLE TIME))
  C7                 B7       Em
A diamond car with a platinum wheel. 

[Chorus]
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi!)

[Verse 4]

Em
  He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
C7                        B7    Em
  Each meal she ate was a dozen courses; 
Em
  She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
    C7                                B7      Em
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

[Chorus]
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi!)
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! (Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho!)

Du siehst so anders aus mit deinem blonden Haar

Weil er es schöner fand, wie es vorher war
    Bm          D
Sag nichts, sag nichts

Ich weiß es ganz genau, ich frag' dich noch einmal

War ein geprügelter Hund, Mann, wie weh so was tut
    Bm          D
Sag nichts, sag nichts
              G
Du stehst mit Koffern da, ich hoff', du kommst wieder heim

Oder packst du vielleicht die letzten Sachen ein?

Sag nichts, sag nichts

```
A              F#m
Almost heaven, West Virginia,
E                     D          A
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                   F#m
Life is old there, older than the trees,
E                           D              A
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.

[Chorus]
A                      E
Country roads, take me home,
       F#m       D
To the place I belong:
     A                  E
West Virginia, mountain momma,
        D             A
Take me home, country roads.

[Verse 2]
A                F#m
All my mem'ries, gather 'round her,
E             D                A
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                F#m
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
E                         D              A
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
F#m        E             A
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me, 
    D       A              E
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    F#m              G
And drivin' down the road,
        D              A                     E
I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday,
      E7
yesterday.
