[Verse 1]
Am                        E7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                        C
Up ahead in the distance,I saw a shimmering light
Dm
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E7
I had to stop for the night

Am                              E7
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
G                                           D
Then I was thinking to myself this could be Heaven or this could be Hell
F                        C
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Dm
There were voices down the corridor, 
E7
I thought I heard them say

[Verse 2]
F                        C
Welcome to the Hotel California
     E7
Such a lovely place
E7
(Such a lovely place)
Am
Such a lovely face
F                               C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Dm
Any time of year
Dm
(Any time of year)
E7
You can find it here

[Verse 3]
Am                           E7
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
G                                    D
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
F                                C
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                      E7
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Am                           E7
So I called up the captain, "Please bring me my wine"
          G                                     D
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
F                                       C
And still those voices are calling from far away
Dm                                     E7
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say

[Chorus]
F                        C
Welcome to the Hotel California
E7
Such a lovely place
E7
(Such a lovely place)
Am
Such a lovely face
F                                  C
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
Dm
What a nice surprise
Dm
(what a nice surprise)
E7
Bring your alibis

[Verse 4]
Am                          E7
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
               G                               D
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
F                            C
And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast
Dm                                              E7
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast

Am                     E7
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                     D
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                    C
"Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
Dm                                   E7
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"
