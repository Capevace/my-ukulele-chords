```
[Verse 1]
     C
It's late at night, I go to bed
    G
But I can't get no rest
    Dm
My boyfriend quit, I'm almost dead
     Am             G
I'll have to do my best
    C
I'm up and down, I feel so fat
   G
I ain't got no more fizz
      Dm
Don't even get to keep the cat
     Am                G
But that's just how it is

[Chorus]
I sing:
C
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
G
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Am                       G
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da-da

Everybody sing:
C
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
G
Wap-bap, ba-da-di-da-da
Am                       G
Wap-bap, ba-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
  C
I get up late, I stub my toe
     G
I've got a few missed calls
  Dm
I lost my job, I didn't know
    Am                  G
And that's not good at all
   C
I get my bag, I go outside
      G
Just mindin' my own biz
  Dm
I go to pay, but my card's been denied
       Am                 G
Well, that's just how it is

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
         C
Another week, the same old shit
    G
My troubles gettin' worse
     Dm
And then I get a bigger hit
        Am              G
'Cause someone stole my purse
   C
I met a guy, he knows my name
    G
He also told me his
    Dm
And if we want to have some fun
       Am                 G
Well, that's just how it is

[Chorus]
