```
[Intro]
Am Dm F C (x3)

[Verse 1]
C           Am
Isn't she lovely?
F         C
Isn't she wonderful?
C           Am     Dm
Isn't she precious?
F    C
Less than one minute old

[Chorus]
F                       Em
I never thought through love we'd be
Am               Dm
Making one as lovely as she
F                 C
But isn't she lovely; made from love?

[Verse 2]
C           Am    Dm
Isn't she pretty?
F     C
Truly the angel's best
C           Am    Dm
Boy, I'm so happy
F       C
We have been Heaven blessed

[Chorus]
F                 Em
I can't believe what God has done
Am                     Dm
Through us he's given life to one
F                 C
But isn't she lovely; made from love?

[Verse 3]
C           Am
Isn't she lovely?
F        C
Life and love are the same
C       Am    Dm
Life is A-isha
F       C
The meaning of her name

[Chorus]
F                    Em
Londie, it could have not been done
Am                   Dm
Without you who conceived the one
F               C
That's so very lovely made from love

[Outro]
Am Dm F C
