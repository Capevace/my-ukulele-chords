Will you tell us that you're ok?
Am                     G      
There's a signe in the window 
        F               E
that he struck you a crescendo Annie.
Am                 G        
He came into your apartment 
         F                  G
left the bloodstains on the carpet
Am                   G        
The you ran into the bedroom, 
         F                   E
you were struck down, it was your doom.
F                 (F)
Annie are you ok? So Annie are you ok?
        G      F
are you ok Annie?
E              STOP                        
You've been hit by, you've been struck by, 
                  Riff
a smooth criminal.
