[Verse 1]
 
D                F#m        Bm
I hear the drums echoing tonight
 
D               C               Em          Bm   C G Em
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
 
D             F#m              Bm
She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
 
    D                 C                   Em                Bm   C G Em
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
 
D            F#m               Bm
I stopped an old man along the way
 
D                   C             Em               Bm   C G Em
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melo-dies
 
   D         F#m         Bm                   C                  G Em
He turned to me as if to say “hurry boy, it's waiting there for you”
 
[Chorus]
 
Am            F               C        G Gsus4 G
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 
Am                     F              C               G Gsus4 G
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 
Am          F              C   G Gsus4 G
I bless the rains down in  Africa
 
Am              F               C              Em G Am
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...
 
G   C G Em
Ooo Ooo
 
C G Em
 
[Verse 2]
 
D             F#m            Bm
The wild dogs cry out in the night
 
    D                  C                Em      Bm   C G Em
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
 
D           F#m              Bm
I know that I must do what's right
 
           D            C           Em               Bm    C G Em
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
 
D         F#m                Bm
I seek to cure what's deep inside
 
Bm                 C                    G Em
Frightened of this thing that I've become
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                 F              C         G Gsus4 G
It’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 
Am                     F              C               G Gsus4 G
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 
Am           F              C   G Gsus4 G
I bless the rains down in  Africa
 
Am               F              C              Em G Am
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...
 
G   C G Em
Ooo Ooo

[Bridge]
 
D   F#7  Bm                    C                  G Em
            “hurry boy, she's waiting there for you”
 
[Outro]
 
Am                 F               C        G Gsus4 G
It’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 
Am                      F              C               G Gsus4 G
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 
Am           F             C   G Gsus4 G
I bless the rains down in  Africa

I bless the rains down in  Africa
 
Am           F             C   G Gsus4 G
I bless the rains down in  Africa
 
Am           F             C   G Gsus4 G
I bless the rains down in  Africa
 
Am               F               C              Em G Am
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had…
