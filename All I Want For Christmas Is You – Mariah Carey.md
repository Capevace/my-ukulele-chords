I don't care about the presents

Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking

There upon the fireplace  (I...)

  Santa Claus won't make me happy

With a toy on Christmas day

I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Eb6
Underneath the mistletoe
G
I won't make a list and send it

To the North Pole for Saint Nick (I...)

  I won't even stay awake to
Eb6
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Em                      Eb6
Holding on to me so tight

What more can I do

Baby all I want for Christmas is
G  Em   C    D
you     You baby

[Bridge]
B7
All the lights are shining
   Em
So brightly everywhere
B7
   And the sound of children's
Em
Laughter fills the air
Eb6
   And everyone is singing
G/D              E7
   I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Am7
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
          Am7/D
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Verse 4]
   G
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
G
This is all I'm asking for
C
I just want to see my baby
Eb6
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]

Oh I just want you for my own
Em                         Eb6
More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true

You   (you  baby)
