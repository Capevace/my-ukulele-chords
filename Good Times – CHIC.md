[Chorus]
     Em7    A7sus4             Dsus2
Good times, these are the good times

A              Em7   A7sus4         
A new state of mind, these are the good times

     Em7    A7sus4             Dsus2
Good times, these are the good times
A                  Em7   A7sus4                    A
Leave your cares behind, these are the good times

[Verse 1]
Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again
Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute poney tails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life

[CHORUS]

[Verse2]
A A rumour has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate
You silly fool, you can't change your fate
Let's cug the rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and rollerskates, rollerskates

[CHORUS]
