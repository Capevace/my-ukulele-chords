## Stand By Me â€“ Ben E. King

![G][] ![Em][] ![C][] ![D][] 

```
G
When the night has come
Em
And the land is dark
             C         D                 G
And the moon is the only light we'll see
G
No, I won't be afraid,
        Em
No, I won't be afraid
              C            D             G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

[Chorus]
G
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Em
Oh, stand by me.
    C     D           G
Oh, stand, stand by me, Stand by me.


G
If the sky that we look upon
Em
Should tumble and fall
C                      D                   G
Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,
G
I won't cry, I won't cry,
       Em
No, I won't shed a tear
        C            D                  G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

[Chorus]

G
Darling, darling, stand by me
     Em
Oh, stand by me
    C         D            G
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me.
G
Whenever you're in trouble
G
Won't you stand by me
     Em
Oh, stand by me
     C          D           G
Woah, stand now, stand by me, stand by me
