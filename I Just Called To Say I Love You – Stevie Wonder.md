```
C   Em         C    Em
No New Year's Day    to celebrate
C                             F
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
Dm                 DmM7
No first of spring
Dm7   DmM7
No song to sing
Dm           G   C    G
In fact here's just another ordinary day

C    Em
No April rain
C     Em
No flowers bloom
C                            F
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
Dm  DmM7              Dm7  DmM7
But what it is,     is something true
Dm                     G             C
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

F         G     C
I just called to say I love you
F         G              Am
I just called to say how much I care
F         G     Am
I just called to say I love you
F                G            C
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

C    Em
No summer's high
C    Em
No warm July
F
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
Dm     DmM7
No autumn breeze
Dm7    DmM7
No falling leaves
Dm                G      C        G
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

C   Em
No Libra sun
C    Em
No Halloween
C                                   F
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
Dm  DmM7               Dm7
But what it is,      though old so new
Dm                  G                C
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

(FROM NOW ON USE THE BRIDGE TO PLAY ALL THE CHORDS BECAUSE THE TONE WENT ONE TONE HIGHER)

F#         G#     C#
I just called to say I love you
F#        G#              Am#
I just called to say how much I care
F#         G#    Am#
I just called to say I love you
F#               G#           C#
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

(THE MELODY WENT UP ON ONE TONE ANOTHER TIME. THIS TIME THE CHORDS ARE MORE ORDINARY. ALSO USE THE BRIDGE TO PLAY THEM)

G         A     D
I just called to say I love you
G         A              Bm
I just called to say how much I care
G         A     Bm
I just called to say I love you
G                A            D
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
