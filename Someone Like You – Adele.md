 G                 D
I heard that you're settled down
        Em                    C
That you found a girl and you're married now.
G                  D
I heard that your dreams came true.
          Em                       C
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
   G                     D
Old friend, why are you so shy?
           Em                  C
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

  Am                         C
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
     Em                   D
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
      Am                          C
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
         Em          D
That for me it isn't over.

G                D                Em    C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you too
         G          D
Don't forget me, I beg
       Em         C
I'll remember you said,
              G                 D                   Em      C
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
            G                 D                     Em      C
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"

    G            D
You know how the time flies
     Em                C
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
        G
We were born and raised
    D
In a summer haze
      Em                     C
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

  Am                         C
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
      Em                  D
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
    Am                       C
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
       Em      D
That for me it isn't over.

G                D                 Em    C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you too
         G         D
Don't forget me, I beg
       Em         C
I'll remember you said,
              G                 D                     Em     C
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."

A
Nothing compares
   C
No worries or cares
Em
Regrets and mistakes
         D
They are memories made.
A                              Em     D          C     D
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

G                D                Em    C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you too
         G         D
Don't forget me, I beg
        Em        C
I'll remember you said,
              G                D                      Em      C D
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead".

Don't forget me, I beg
        Em        C
I'll remember you said,
              G                D                      Em     C

             G                D                      Em     C
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."
