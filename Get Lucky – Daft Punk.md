[Intro]
Bm  D  Gbm  E

[Verse 1]
                       Bm         D
Like the legend of the phoenix
                Gbm         E
All ends were beginnings 
                      Bm          D
What keeps the planet spinning
                     Gbm          E
The force from the beginning

[Pre-Chorus]
Bm             D           Gbm       E
We've come too far to give up who we are
   Bm              D           Gbm         E
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

[Chorus]
Bm
She's up all night 'til the sun
D
I'm up all night to get some
Gbm
She's up all night for good fun
E
I'm up all night to get lucky

Bm
We're up all night 'til the sun
D
We're up all night to get some
Gbm
We're up all night for good fun
E
We're up all night to get lucky

Bm
We're up all night to get lucky
D
We're up all night to get lucky
Gbm
We're up all night to get lucky
E
We're up all night to get lucky

[Interlude]
Bm  D  Gbm  E

[Verse 2]
                   Bm        D
The present has no rhythm
                   Gbm       E
Your gift keeps on giving
                 Bm          D
What is this I'm feeling?
                         Gbm        E
If you want to leave I'm with it

[Pre-Chorus]
