Some folks are born made to wave the flag,
C7 C7                          G G
ooh, they're red, white and blue.
G G                        F F
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief"
C7 C7                             G G
they point the cannon right at you.

It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no senator's son.
G G            D7 D7           C7 C7             G G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand,
C7 C7                         G G
Lord, don't they help themselves.
G G                    F F
But when the tax man comes to the door:
C7 C7                            G G
"Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale."

G G            D7 D7           C7 C7             G G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no millionaire's son.
G G            D7 D7           C7 C7             G G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes,
C7 C7                         G G
ooh, they send you down to war.
G G                      F F
And when you ask them: "How much should we give?"
C7 C7                          G G
Oh, they only answer: "More, more, more"

G G            D7 D7           C7 C7             G G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no military's son.
G G            D7 D7           C7 C7             G G
It ain't me, it ain't me, I'm no fortunate one.
