Am                                Em7  G   Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Am                           Em7  G   Am
It?s not warm when she's away
                             Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                          Dm
And she?s always gone too long
                  Am  Em7  G   Am
Anytime she goes away

Am                               Em7  G   Am
Wonder this time where she's gone
Am                           Em7  G   Am
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                             Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                             Dm
And this house just ain't no home
                  Am  Em7  G   Am
Anytime she goes away
Am 
I know I know I know I know I know I know etc

          Am/C                   Em7
I oughtta leave the young thing alone
                   Dm
But there ain't no sunshine
          Am  Em7  G   Am
When she's gone
Am                            Am  Em7  G   Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Am                Am  Em7  G   Am
Only darkness everyday 
                             Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she?s gone
                             Dm
And this house just ain't no home
                  Am  Em7  G   Am
Anytime she goes away
                  Am  Em7  G   Am
Anytime she goes away
                  Am  Em7  G   Am
Anytime she goes away
                  Am  Em7  G   Am
Anytime she goes away
