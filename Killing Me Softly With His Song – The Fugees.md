[Chorus]
Em                         Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                       G
Singing my life with his words
Em                     A
Killing me softly with his song
           D           C
Killing me softly with his song
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words
           Fmaj7
Killing me softly
         E
With his song

[Instrumental Break] (x4)
Am7 D

[Verse 1]
Am7           D
   I heard he sang a good song
G             C
   I heard he had a style
Am7         D
   And so I came to see him
      Em
   To listen for a while
Am7             D7
   And there he was this young boy
G             B7
   A stranger to my eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Am7           D
   I felt all flushed with fever
G              C
   Embarrassed by the crowd
Am7          D
   I felt he found my letters
       Em
   And read each one out loud
Am7              D7
   I prayed that he would finish
G              B7
   But he just kept right on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Am7           D
   He sang as if he knew me
G            C
   In all my dark despair
Am7            D
   And then he looked right through me
      Em
   As if I wasn't there
Am7            D7
   And he just kept on singing
G          B7
   Singing clear and strong

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Em   Am
  Oooooooh
D7   G
Oooooooooh
Em          A
La la la la la la
D    C
Oooooooooh
G    C
Laaaaaaaaa
Fmaj7
E
Laaaaaaaa

[Chorus]

[Outro]
       Em                 Am
He was strumming my pain
             D7         G
Yeah, he was singing my life
Em                     A
Killing me softly with his song
           D           C
Killing me softly with his song
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words
        Fmaj7
Killing me softly
         E
With his song
