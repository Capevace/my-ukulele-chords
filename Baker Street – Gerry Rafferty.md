[Verse 1]
A                Asus4    A            Asus4
 Winding your way down on Baker Street
A                Asus4   A                Asus4
 Lite in your head, and dead on your feet
        Em                   G
Well an- other crazy day, you drink the night away
        D            Dsus4   D
And for- get about e- very- thing

A                Asus4     A                 Asus4
 This city desert makes you feel so cold, it's got
A              Asus4    A           Asus4
 So many people but it's got no soul
       Em                    G
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
        D                 Dsus4   D
When you thought it held e- very- thing

[Chorus 1]
Dm7                           Am   Asus2   Am
 You used to think that it was so ea-       sy
Dm7                         Am   Asus2   Am
 You used to say that it was so ea-        sy
   C             G            D     Dsus2 - D - Dsus4 - D
But you're tryin, you're tryin now
Dm7                        Am   Asus2   Am
 Another year and then you'd be ha-      ppy
Dm7                              Am   Asus2   Am
 Just one more year and then you'd be ha-      ppy
   C             G             A     F
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now

[Verse 2]
A                     Asus2     A                    Asus2
  Way down the street there's a light in his place
   A              Asus2          A                  Asus2
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
       Em                              G
And he asks you where you've been, you tell him who you've seen
        D            Dsus4   D
And you talk about a- ny-     thing
 
A                      Asus2   A                 Asus2
 He's got this dream a- bout   buyin' some land
          A                 Asus2   A                  Asus2
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
    Em                              G
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
        D           Dsus4   D
And for- get about e- very- thing

[Chorus 2]
Dm7                       Am   Asus2   Am
 But you know he'll always keep mo-     ving
Dm7                       Am   Asus2   Am
 You know he's never gonna stop mo-     ving
     C           G                 D
Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone
Dm7                         Am   Asus2   Am
 And when you wake up it's a new mor-     ning
Dm7                       Am   Asus2   Am
 The sun is shining it's a new   mor-    ning
    C            G            A      F
And you're going, you're going home
